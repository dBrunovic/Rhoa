# Rhoa
Path Of Exile item searcher utilizing poe.trade

It is recommended to run POE in Windowed Fullscreen mode.


SETUP:

To use Rhoa, please install AutoHotKey. There is a sample script provided called "AutoHotkeyRhoa.ahk".

Open the script with any text editor and edit the part where it says

"WRITE_THE_PATH_TO_YOUR_RHOA.EXE_HERE"

Instead of that, write the path to the location of Rhoa.exe on your system.

You can change the hotkey that runs Rhoa by changing the top line in the script. The current line specifies that the key combination SHIFT+ALT+C will run rhoa.
Load the script with AutoHotKey.

Once in POE, hover over an item and press the key combination specified in the autohotkey script. A form will appear with the item mods loaded. Once you modified them to how you want to search, click the search button.
